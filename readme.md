### 💯 Rules:

### 🤷‍♂️ How To:

1. We have compiled a few repos from various domains like web dev, game dev and AI/ML. You can find the list [here](repos.md).
2. While you are welcome to contribute to the repositories listed throughout October, we want to emphasize that there are no limitations on your choices. Feel free to contribute to any open-source repository that interests you.
3. When ever you open an issue or a pr on that repo create a file with this format {YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE.md} in this repo and link the pr. In addition to that it would be great if you can summarize your contribution.
